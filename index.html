                I'm a Frontend Developer looking to increase the profitability
                of your business by creating seamless, beautiful, modern designs with 
                emphasis on user experience and accessibility. When I'm not at my computer
                I can be found exploring trails with my dog, painting, or enjoying a coffee 
                with my boyfriend.

                   I love being able to look for new opportunities for
                   growth and education. I'm continuously researching 
                   better practices in coding and demonstrating my new 
                   knowledge through personal projects.

                   My biggest motivation for learning
                   programming is the accessibility this career would bring 
                   to my life. I love being able to travel, go out to eat, or
                   even just snuggle my dog on a whim. The freedom to work from 
                   home would allow me to do all my favorite things.

                    The kind of technology available in Iron Man, makes me wish
                    we had that sort of tech on the market for the consumer. With
                    the ability to look at structures within the body, within a city, 
                    underground, then surgeries, city projects, and expeditions would 
                    be safer and provide a more accurate picture for the finished project
                    or procedure.
